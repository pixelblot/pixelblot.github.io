        At Pixelblot, we want mental health care to be proactive, personal, and within reach for everyone.
        We build AI tools that analyze how people interact with technology to catch early signs of mental health challenges.
        Instead of waiting for symptoms to worsen, we offer real-time, data-driven insights — fast, continuous, and private.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Screening & Monitoring:</strong> We use digital behavior to passively flag early signs of distress — without surveys or clinics — and track how mental health changes over time.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Personalized Support:</strong> We learn from individual patterns to predict rough patches and suggest timely, tailored interventions — from simple digital nudges to professional help.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Clinician Tools:</strong> We provide real-time decision support, turning complex data into clear, actionable insights.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        <strong>Population Insight:</strong> Aggregated, anonymized data helps identify trends and hotspots — informing better responses in public mental health.
      </p>

      <p style="text-align: justify;">
        We're building AI that turns digital behavior into mental health insight. The goal: earlier support, better outcomes, for more people.
