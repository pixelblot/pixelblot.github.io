At Pixelblot, we want mental health care to be proactive, personal, and within reach for everyone. We're building tools to catch early signs of mental health challenges by analyzing how people interact with technology. Instead of waiting for symptoms to get worse, we aim to support people and clinicians with real-time insights — fast, accurate, and data-driven.

<h2 id="content">Screening</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We use digital behavior to flag early signs of distress — before things escalate. No surveys, no clinics. Just subtle, continuous screening built into everyday tech.
</p>

<h2 id="content">Monitoring</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Mental health changes over time — and we track it in real-time. Passive data helps us catch shifts in mood, focus, or energy that often go unnoticed.

<h2 id="content">Personalized Interventions</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We don’t believe in one-size-fits-all. By learning from your patterns, we can predict rough patches and suggest timely, tailored support — from a breathing app to professional help.
</p>

<h2 id="content">Decision Support</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
We turn complex data into clear insights. Clinicians get real-time support for decisions — what’s changing, what’s working, and what’s not.
</p>

<h2 id="content">Public mental health</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Aggregated, anonymized data helps us spot larger patterns — what communities are struggling, when, and how we can respond earlier.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We're building AI that turns digital behavior into mental health insight. The goal: better outcomes, earlier support, for more people.
