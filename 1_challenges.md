<h2 id="content">Magnitude and Impact of Mental Health Challenges</h2>
<p>Mental health disorders are the leading cause of disability worldwide. During their lifetime, one in three people will develop a diagnosable mental health condition, and at any given time, one in eight adults meets the criteria for mental illness. Depression alone is projected to become the leading cause of disease globally by 2030. The economic impact is equally profound, with mental health conditions costing nearly $2.5 trillion globally in 2010 — a figure expected to rise to over $6 trillion by 2030. Beyond these economic impacts, mental health conditions severely affect individuals' quality of life, relationships, productivity, and overall well-being.</p>

<h2 id="content">Barriers to Timely Mental Health Care</h2>
<p>A major barrier in mental health care is the substantial delay in diagnosis and treatment. For many disorders, the duration of untreated illness frequently spans several years. For example, individuals living with obsessive-compulsive disorder typically wait an average of seven years before receiving a diagnosis. Traditional language-based assessments are often subjective, infrequent, and rely heavily on self-reporting. The absence of scalable, continuous, and objective assessment tools means subtle changes in perception, cognition, emotion, and behavior — early indicators of emerging mental health issues — often go unnoticed until conditions worsen. This delay allows disorders to progress, which causes chronic challenges that are often resistant to treatment.</p>
