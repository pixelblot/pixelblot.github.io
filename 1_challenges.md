  <h2 id="content">Magnitude and Impact of Mental Health Challenges</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    Mental health is the leading cause of disability worldwide. One in three people will experience a mental health condition in their life. At any time, one in eight adults has a diagnosable disorder. Depression is projected to be the top global health burden by 2030. In 2010, mental illness cost the world $2.5 trillion — this is expected to reach $6 trillion by 2030. Beyond the numbers, mental health deeply affects relationships, work, and daily life.

  <h2 id="content">Barriers to Timely Mental Health Care</h2>
  <p style="text-align: justify;">
    A major barrier in mental health care is the substantial delay in diagnosis and treatment. For many disorders, the duration of untreated illness frequently spans several years. Current assessments are based on language and self-report, which can be unreliable and rare. This means that early signs are often missed — and people suffer longer than they should.
