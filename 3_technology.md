<p>At Pixelblot, we developed MINDMAP (Mapping INdividual Digital behavior to MentAl health And Psychopathology). MINDMAP opens the door to faster, more accurate, and more compassionate mental health care for everyone.</p>

<hr class="major" />

<h2 id="content">How MINDMAP works</h2>
<p>MINDMAP uses everyday digital behavior to better understand and monitor mental health. People’s online behavior can reveal subtle yet important patterns related to mental health. Our tools detect changes that often remain unnoticed by traditional assessments without interfering with normal activities or requiring additional effort from users.

MINDMAP identifies meaningful digital biomarkers — objective measures of the thougts and emotions that define mental helaht. By mapping these digital markers onto clearly defined mental health dimensions, our approach offers an intuitive and powerful way to detect early warning signs, track symptom development, and capture mental states in real time..</p>

<h2 id="content">What This Means for Mental Health Care</h2>
<p>By using digital behaviors as markers of mental health, we move beyond traditional questionnaires and subjective self-reporting methods, which are scarce, and rely on the ability of individuals to introspect and report their mental health. MINDMAP provides a scalable, real-time solution for screening, continuous monitoring, and personalized care. This approach allows clinicians and individuals to see how mental health changes from day to day and respond immediately when issues emerge, rather than waiting until they become chronic and harder to treat.</br>

MINDMAP supports mental health professionals in making informed decisions by providing clear, actionable insights into patients’ ongoing mental health status. For individuals, it means more timely support, tailored interventions, and better long-term outcomes.</p>
