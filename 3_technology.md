At Pixelblot, we built MINDMAP — short for Mapping INdividual Digital behavior to MentAl health And Psychopathology. It’s our way of turning everyday digital activity into meaningful mental health insight. Fast. Scalable. Human-centered.

<h2 id="content">How MINDMAP works</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Our behavior online reflects how we feel — often before we even realize it ourselves. MINDMAP picks up on subtle shifts in interaction patterns that traditional assessments miss. No extra steps for the user. No interruptions. Just real-world signals, passively collected.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
We extract digital biomarkers — behavioral fingerprints tied to thoughts, mood, and attention — and map them to core dimensions of mental health. This lets us detect early warning signs, track symptom changes, and estimate mental state in real time.

<h2 id="content">What this means</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Mental health care today depends on rare check-ins and self-reports. It’s slow, subjective, and often too late. With MINDMAP, we flip the model — from reactive to real-time. Clinicians get clear, continuous insights. People get faster, more tailored support.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
It’s a shift toward care that adapts — tracking daily changes, surfacing patterns, and enabling action before things get worse. Better outcomes, fewer delays.
